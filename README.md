# vim-config
You can either download the .vimrc and install the plugins manually. Or you can use the installation
script which can be obtained via 
	'wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/benjaminlyons/vim-config/master/vim_config_install.sh'
Then you can run the script with ./vim_config_install.sh. It will probably work.

Note that this script will replace your vimrc with mine, but it will save a copy of your vimrc in 
the home directory called .vimrc_old. This is not meant to be a perfect vimrc, but it is a good
starting point for beginners.
